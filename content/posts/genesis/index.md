This is both a beginning and a test -- a "hello, world!" kind of post, if you
will.
{% end %}

In my reading, I tend to jump from one topic to another a lot... A LOT. So, when
I'm diving deep into a topic, I really depend on a routine of extensive writing
and note-taking -- otherwise my thoughts scatter.

It has been a while that I didn't feel like sharing anything in this format.
Now, some of these notes need to be shared with others -- some friends. So I
decided to set up this place to share those notes in a more centralised way. I'm
not sure if anything here will be particularly new or novel, but if it happens
to be, I'd be happy about that.

The first thing that I'm going to shared will be some of my notes on the
fascinating (one of my favourites) *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach* book by Douglas
Hofstadter.
